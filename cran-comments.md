## Resubmission

This is a resubmission of vectorialcalculus 1.0.5.

- Removed the redundant "in R" from the package title.
- Added references for the implemented methods to the Description field, following CRAN guidelines.
- Cleaned and updated all examples:
  * Removed commented-out example code.
  * Replaced \dontrun{} with \donttest{} where appropriate.
  * Ensured that examples run quickly or are safely wrapped in \donttest{}.
